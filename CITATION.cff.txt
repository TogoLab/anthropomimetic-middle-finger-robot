abstract: >
  This repository provides open-hardware design data for a robotic finger
  that mimics the anatomical structure of the human middle finger.
  The project is intended for educational and research purposes and enables
  comparison between anthropomimetic joint mechanisms and conventional
  robotic joints without requiring any software or microcontrollers.
